I am Ryo Nakamura, a data scientist at Tenchijin Inc. In my work, I tackle social issues through data aggregation and machine learning related to Earth data.

In addition, I am involved in running SatAI.challenge, a study group community for satellite data and AI, and cvpaper.challenge. I am working to revitalize satellite data, AI, and computer vision technologies in Japan.

I obtained my Ph.D. (Science) in 2023 under the guidance of Professor Jun Fujiki (formerly Professor Masaru Tanaka) at Fukuoka University and as a research assistant (RA) under Hirokatsu Kataoka at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), with experience in top-tier computer vision conference acceptances and workshop organization.
