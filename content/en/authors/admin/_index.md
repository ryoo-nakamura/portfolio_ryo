I am Ryo Nakamura, working as a data scientist at Tenchijin Inc. In my work, I tackle social problems by using Earth-related data to reduce costs and automate operations.

Additionally, as personal activities, I organize the SatAI.challenge (a community for learning satellite data and AI) and cvpaper.challenge. Through these, I aim to boost the growth of satellite data, AI, and computer vision technologies in Japan.

Under the supervision of Professor Jun Fujiki (formerly Professor Masaru Tanaka) at Fukuoka University and working as a research assistant under Hirokatsu Kataoka at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), I gained experience in having papers accepted at top computer vision conferences and organizing workshops. I obtained my Doctor of Science degree in 2023.
